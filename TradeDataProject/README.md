# Import and Export Data Project

In this project I used the UN database to retrieve the import and export data of nations throughout the years.
I used Python and the Pandas library to process the data into a way that would be easily read by Tableau. 
Then I used Tableau to make a dashboard which allows a user to explore the data.
